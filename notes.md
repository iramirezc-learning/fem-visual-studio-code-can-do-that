# Course Notes

## Introduction

🙇🏻‍♂️ **What I've learned**
 
 I have learned the essential [shortcuts](./shortcuts.md) for VSCode as well as the names of some parts of the editor, like the sidebar, the status bar, the command pallette, etc.

 I also learned some useful [commands](./commands.md) for inspecting which processes are running to an specific port.
